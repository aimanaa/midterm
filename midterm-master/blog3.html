		<p>The last time I had dinner with my family, something strange happened…

Over Labor Day, I made a quick trip home, and on the first night back in Missouri, my family was unusually chatty during dinner. The Mom-pausing-mid-story-to-catch-her-breath-and-angsty-teenage-brother-chiming-in-with-anecdotes kind of chatty. Who were these people? This was not my family.</p>
		
		<p>Recently I was reading this guide about how to be better at parties (as one does), and I came across this part: “Remember that conversation is part of what you bring to any social event. Ms. Fine [author of The Fine Art of Small Talk] said, ‘I don’t walk into a party without two to three things to talk about.’ These topics can be anything that’s interesting to you in the moment, and you need not even talk about them — but they are there if you need them.” Further proof that parents have most of life’s answers.

Any other tips you have for getting conversations rolling? Any questions? A friend of mine has a rule with his mother that they won’t talk in the car on the way to a restaurant to make sure they won’t run out of things to discuss later, haha.</p>
