Edinburgh is one of those places i’ve been desperate to visit for a really long time. I went last year to do a book signing, but all I saw was the book shop, the hotel & the airport. I didn’t quite get the fill of historic Edinburgh that I had hoped and I always hear so many amazing things about it so I sat down with Poppy one afternoon and booked it. We decided to do a road trip (I know, you probably think i’m crazy) but there is something I find quite fun about driving and it adds something extra to the experience. All the best chats, lols and singing happen on long road trips and trust me, this was an epic one. Myself, Alfie, Poppy & Sean set off in the morning and headed to Liverpool for the first night. As I was appointed the driver, I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to do the full 8 hours in one day, so we decided to split the journey and make the most of Liverpool on our way up. I’ve visited Liverpool a few times before and I absolutely love it. It’s one of those cities that feels so clean and spacious and the people of Liverpool are always some of the most friendly and compassionate people you will ever meet. We stayed at the Titanic Hotel, which we found online as we were instantly drawn into the cool warehouse vibe of the rooms (it may have also been because of my love of all things Titanic related). The staff here were lovely and extremely tentative and the evening meal we had down in the restaurant was one of the best meals i’ve had in a long time. The atmosphere was just as I like it, dim light and lot’s of space (sounds particular but there’s nothing worse than a crowded, hot restaurant with bright lights…someone tell me i’m not alone here). </p>

The next morning we all packed up the car and set off for Edinburgh. The drive up through the green hills was so breathtakingly beautiful. Although we drove 4 hours on the same stretch of road (I think I’ve driven the entirety of the M6) every bend we went round there was a view that looked like something from a postcard. There was not one part of me in that moment that wished I’d hopped on a plane instead, I’m not sure the boys who were sat in the back would agree with me though. We decided to stay in an AirBnb for our trip. I’ve personally never used AirBnb before, but I was very excited to give it a go and we found the perfect flat that was a great walking distance from both the new town and old town.</p></div>
