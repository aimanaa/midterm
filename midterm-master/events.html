	<p> The treehouse itself was absolutely amazing. It had everything you could ever need and more. One thing I did take into consideration when booking this, was that I wanted it to be a place that we could still do things if it was raining, or if the sun happened to have his hat on. Luckily we experienced both weathers, but I honestly think regardless of the time of year, these treehouses are great little getaway homes. With things like the coffee machine, and the complimentary hot chocolate buttons and mini marshmallows, the hot water bottles on the bed and the log burner that they clean and set up for you every day, mean that if when the weather is a little more wintery, it still accommodates that. If anything, I think these would be so cosy in the slightly more wintery months. You can still get in a warm hot tub on the balcony in the snow and pop your scarves and coats on for crisp walks after all! One thing myself and Alfie did love was the tablet on which you could order room service. The treehouse service offers breakfast in the manor if you so wish, or the choice of having your breakfast delivered in the morning between 7-7.30am through a secret hatch from the outside in a picnic hamper. This meant that regardless of what time we woke up, our little hamper would be sat waiting for us full of breakfast goodies. The hamper certainly didn’t disappoint either. Each morning there are juices, pastries, yoghurts and fruit and then something different. One morning we woke up to the addition of pancakes, baguettes and salami and the next morning we were greeted with muesli, salmon and cream cheese. We were always defeated by the amount of food, although having a mini fridge and freezer meant you could save bits for when you got peckish throughout the day. </p>

The tablet also had options for other hampers, there was a three course meal hamper where you could make each selection, and handmade pizza hamper (yes, I did chose this option and MY GOODNESS THE PIZZA WAS DELICIOUS) and there was a night owl service where they had bacon sandwiches, sausage sandwiches, toasties, brownies and mini pots of ice cream. It’s also worth noting here, that one afternoon Alfie and I wanted lunch, and although there wasn’t a lunch hamper, we called reception and asked what lunch options there were and they basically said “What would you like? We can make you anything”. If that’s not great room service I don’t know what is. The whole premise behind the hatch in the treehouse was that a lot people visit to get away and to be alone and relaxed, so by using the hatch, it meant you don’t have to see anyone. If you’re in your pyjamas, or you’ve just jumped out the bath, you don’t need to scramble around for a towel and look half presentable before opening the door, because you don’t need to open the door. BRILLIANT! I also just want to note here, that everything worked. You know sometimes when you get into a lovely hotel room and you go to turn the tv on and you get 4 channels, or the “great wifi” is really not so great, we had NONE of those issues. Everything was just as they said it would be.</p></div>
